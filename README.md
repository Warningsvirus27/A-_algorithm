# A-_algorithm
This is a path finding visualizer that uses A* algorithm and pygame

The program uses A* algorithm to find the shortest path between start and end points

we can make an start node by pressing the 'i' key at mouse cursor
same for the end node

once start and end points are created the algorithm starts by pressing the 'space bar'
and it was go through the traceresed node and find the best shortes path between the start and end

-- we can also create obstacles (black boxes) by prssing the 'left mouse' button
-- we can also remove obstacles (black box) by pressing the 'right mouse' button
-- we can also remove the start or end node and again re initialize them to other node place
